            <h1>Gas:</h1>

            Pilots have to pay for the amount of propane they actually filled their cylinders with. The same method will
            be applied as the Europeans 2015. The method is to pay the amount calculated, based on the number of planned
            flights (50 kg per flight, 5 flights at the training competition, 1,5 €/kg) in advance at the check-in, and
            in the end the actual amount put into the cylinders will be calculated and the difference in cost will be
            paid back <img id="kep" src="Images/dubai.jpg">
